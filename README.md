# NC Games: Frontend Project

## About the project

This is my Northcoders frontend project built using React and utilising the server I built for my Northcoders [backend project](https://github.com/Alex-J-Jackson/backend-project-nc-games). The project is a reviews website for boardgames. It includes the functionality to filter reviews by category, sort them, see individual reviews and comments, vote (and remove a vote) for a review and to post and delete comments as a logged in user.

# NC Games: Frontend Project

## About the project

This is my Northcoders frontend project built using React and utilising the server I built for my Northcoders [backend project](https://github.com/Alex-J-Jackson/backend-project-nc-games). The project is a reviews website for boardgames. It includes the functionality to see all reviews using pagination, filter them by category, sort them, see individual reviews and comments, vote on them, post and delete comments as a logged in user, post new reviews and see the user's posted reviews along with a delete option.

# NC Games: Frontend Project

## About the project

This is my Northcoders frontend project built using React and utilising the server I built for my Northcoders [backend project](https://github.com/Alex-J-Jackson/backend-project-nc-games). The project is a reviews website for boardgames. It includes the functionality to see all reviews using pagination, filter reviews by category, sort them, see individual reviews and comments, vote (and remove a vote) for a review, post and delete comments as a logged in user and to post a new review. It also allows you to see the reviews of the logged in user with a view to adding a delete function for posted reviews.
